A strange dungeon where you need to dance... weird

---

You are a mage, a mage who has the ability to cast fireballs, but is also quite a good dancer, but after a long night of sleep, you wake up inside of a dungeon, with a voice coming from the walls, telling you in a robotic voice that they'll test you, not only in your abilities to defend yourself, but also, if you are good on your feet while doing it.
